# Service Outage Postmortem - README

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** The outage occurred on February 5, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 1:30 PM (UTC).
- **Impact:** The outage affected the availability and performance of our web application, resulting in a 30% reduction in user access and a degraded user experience.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer, which led to an overload on one of our backend servers.

## Timeline:
- **Detection:** The issue was detected at 10:00 AM (UTC) when monitoring alerts indicated a significant increase in server response times.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Engineers immediately investigated the issue, focusing on backend server performance and network connectivity.
  - Initially, there was an assumption that the database server might be experiencing issues due to recent updates.
  - The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation.
- **Resolution:** 
  - After thorough analysis, it was discovered that the load balancer was misconfigured, causing an uneven distribution of traffic to backend servers.
  - The load balancer configuration was adjusted to evenly distribute incoming requests among all backend servers.
  - Service was restored gradually, with full functionality returning by 1:30 PM (UTC).

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:** The misconfiguration of the load balancer resulted in an imbalance in traffic distribution, overloading one of the backend servers.
- **Resolution:** The load balancer configuration was corrected to evenly distribute traffic among all available backend servers, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement automated monitoring for load balancer configurations to detect and prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
  - Conduct regular audits of network infrastructure to identify and rectify any potential issues proactively.
- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  1. Review and update load balancer configurations to ensure proper traffic distribution.
  2. Implement automated alerts for load balancer performance and configuration changes.
  3. Conduct training sessions for engineering teams to enhance awareness of load balancer management best practices.

By addressing the root cause of the outage and implementing corrective measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future, ensuring the continued reliability and performance of our services.
